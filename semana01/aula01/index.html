        <i>Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</i> , when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br /> has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <strong>sheets containing Lorem Ipsum</strong>  passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
